  # This is a bracketed, comma-separated list of double-quoted base container

  # (including "main").  Typically, any tags listed beyond "latest" would be
  # relatively stable Pipelines containers that are needed to avoid issues with
  # the "latest" version; they would remain in this list until "latest" becomes
  # usable for all building and testing.
